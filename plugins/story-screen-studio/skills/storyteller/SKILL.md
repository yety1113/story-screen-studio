# Storyteller

## Overview
This skill crafts compelling narratives using proven story structures—from the Hero's Journey and three-act structure to the single-scene vignette and brand origin format. It covers character development, scene-setting, dialogue, pacing, and the specific techniques that create emotional resonance: show don't tell, sensory detail, tension and release. Whether you're writing a short story opening, a founder's origin narrative for a pitch deck, or a bedtime story, this skill produces writing that keeps readers turning pages.

## When to Use
- Writing short fiction (stories, flash fiction, vignettes)
- Crafting a brand or founder origin story
- Developing character profiles or backstories
- Writing narrative-driven marketing content (case studies with story structure)
- Creating opening scenes, chapter hooks, or story pitches
- Writing speeches or presentations with a narrative arc
- Developing scripts or story outlines

## When NOT to Use
- Purely informational articles or documentation (use `technical-writer` or `blog-post` skills)
- Conversion-focused marketing copy without narrative (use `copywriter` skill)
- Academic essays where narrative would be inappropriate (use `academic-essay` skill)
- Factual reporting or news content

## Quick Reference
| Task | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Three-act structure | Setup → Confrontation → Resolution |
| Hero's Journey | Ordinary world → Call → Trials → Transformation → Return |
| In medias res | Open in the middle of action, fill context in later |
| Show don't tell | "She clenched her jaw" not "She was angry" |
| Scene-setting | 2–3 precise sensory details, not a catalog of the room |
| Dialogue | Each character has a distinct voice; dialogue reveals character and moves plot |
| Pacing | Short sentences = fast/tense; long sentences = slow/reflective |
| Conflict types | Person vs. person, person vs. self, person vs. nature, person vs. society |

## Instructions

1. **Define the story's core emotional question.** Every great story asks a question that keeps readers engaged: Will she escape? Can he forgive himself? Will they make it in time? Identify this before writing.

2. **Choose a story structure.**

   **Three-Act Structure** (universal, flexible):
   - Act 1 (25%): Establish the world and protagonist; introduce the inciting incident
   - Act 2 (50%): Rising conflict, complications, darkest moment
   - Act 3 (25%): Climax and resolution

   **Hero's Journey** (character transformation stories):
   1. Ordinary World: Show who the hero is before the story starts
   2. Call to Adventure: Something disrupts the status quo
   3. Refusal/Acceptance: Internal conflict before committing
   4. Trials and Allies: Tests that reveal character
   5. Ordeal: The central crisis
   6. Transformation: The hero is fundamentally changed
   7. Return: Back to the ordinary world, but different

   **In Medias Res** (short fiction, openings):
   - Drop directly into action; establish context through what characters say and do, not exposition

   **Kishōtenketsu** (Japanese 4-act structure, no conflict required):
   - Ki: Introduce characters/setting
   - Shō: Develop the situation
   - Ten: Twist or unexpected turn
   - Ketsu: Reconcile and resolve

   **Brand Origin Structure** (for companies and founders):
   - The world before the founder saw the problem
   - The specific moment they felt the pain
   - The failed attempts to solve it with existing solutions
   - The breakthrough or insight
   - The mission going forward

3. **Build the character.** For any protagonist, establish:
   - **Want:** What they consciously pursue
   - **Need:** What they actually require (often different from want)
   - **Wound:** The backstory that shaped them
   - **Flaw:** The thing that makes them human and relatable
   - **Voice:** How they speak—vocabulary, rhythm, what they avoid saying

4. **Write scenes, not summaries.** Scenes happen in real time, in a specific place, with characters doing and saying things. Summaries skip time. Use scenes for what matters; use summary for transitions.

5. **Apply "show don't tell."** Tell: "He was nervous." Show: "He refreshed the email three times in a minute." Convert internal states to external, observable behavior.

6. **Use sensory detail selectively.** Don't describe everything—choose 2–3 specific, surprising details that do double work: establish setting AND reveal character or theme. "The apartment smelled like cigarettes and fresh paint" tells you more than a paragraph of description.

7. **Write dialogue that earns its place.** Every line of dialogue should do at least two things: reveal character, move plot, establish conflict, or provide information. Cut dialogue that only conveys information. Give each character a distinct speech pattern.

8. **Control pacing deliberately.**
   - Fast pace: Short sentences. Fragment. White space. Action verbs.
   - Slow pace: Longer, winding sentences that linger on sensation, creating a meditative quality that allows the reader to breathe.
   - Vary rhythm intentionally to control emotional effect.

9. **For brand/founder stories:** Stay specific and personal. Vague mission statements are forgettable. The moment the founder spilled coffee on her laptop and realized every portable stand was designed for left-handers is unforgettable.

## Examples

### Example 1: Short Story Opening

**Input:** "Write the opening scene of a short story about a lighthouse keeper who discovers the light has gone out on the night of the worst storm in decades. Tone: tense, literary. Third-person limited POV."

**Output:**

---

The bulb had never died before. Not once in nineteen years.

Maren stood in the lamp room with a dead flashlight in one hand and the emergency manual in the other, listening to the storm disassemble the world outside. Forty-foot swells, the radio had said at six. That was two hours ago. By now the swells were whatever they were and the ships were wherever they were and the light—the one thing between them—was dark.

She found the replacement bulb by feel, wedged behind the maintenance log in a bracket she'd installed herself the winter after her father died. Her hands knew where it was before her mind did. That was what nineteen years felt like: the body remembering what the mind forgot to.

The replacement slotted in with a click that felt too small for how much was riding on it.

She pressed the switch.

Nothing.

She counted to three, the way her father had taught her. *Don't panic until you've waited. The mind invents failures the hands can fix.*

She pressed it again.

The light bloomed into the dark and swept the wall in one slow revolution, and somewhere below, through two panes of glass and forty feet of screaming wind, she thought she heard the ocean give something back.

---

**Craft notes:**
- Opens with the core problem in the first line
- "The storm disassemble the world" — metaphor that establishes tone without over-description
- Character's backstory (19 years, her father) woven into action, not stated as exposition
- "Three panes of glass and forty feet of screaming wind" — precise sensory detail does more than a paragraph of storm description
- Ending: ambiguous resolution that opens rather than closes

### Example 2: Brand Origin Story

**Input:** "Write a founder origin story for a company called Rootwork that makes tools for genealogy researchers. Founder: Diane, a Black American woman who started researching her family history after her grandmother died and hit walls with traditional genealogy tools designed around European surname conventions. Keep it under 300 words."

**Output:**

---

**How Rootwork Started**

After her grandmother Lottie died, Diane wanted to know who came before her.

Not just names and dates. Names and dates she could get. She wanted to know what Lottie's mother's hands looked like when they worked, where exactly in Georgia her great-great-grandmother had been born, and whether anyone had written down what she liked to cook.

She tried the big genealogy platforms. She learned quickly that these tools had been built for a particular kind of family history—the kind traced through last names that stayed stable across generations. Her family's history didn't work that way. Enslaved ancestors were listed by first name only, if at all. Counties had changed. Records had burned. The search fields assumed a paper trail that slavery had deliberately destroyed.

The tools weren't wrong, exactly. They just weren't built for her.

So she started building something that was.

Rootwork is designed around the research patterns that oral histories, freedmen's bureau records, DNA matches, and community documentation actually require. It treats the absence of a document not as a dead end but as a data point. It connects researchers to archives that most platforms don't index, and to a community of genealogists doing the same painstaking, necessary work.

Lottie lived to ninety-one and never knew her grandmother's full name. Diane thinks about that every day.

Rootwork is for everyone who hits a wall in their family history—and especially for those whose walls were built by design.

---

**Craft notes:**
- Opens with a specific, human moment (grandmother's death) not a mission statement
- "What Lottie's mother's hands looked like when they worked" — specific detail that makes the desire feel real
- The problem is explained through lived experience, not product positioning
- The product introduction comes after the reader is emotionally invested
- Closes with the theme: walls "built by design"—gives purpose without a slogan

## Best Practices
- Start in the middle of something happening—readers don't need backstory before they have a reason to care
- Give your protagonist something to lose; stakes are what create tension
- Earn your ending: the resolution should feel inevitable in hindsight but surprising in the moment
- Use white space strategically—a short paragraph after a long one creates emphasis and pause
- Read dialogue aloud; if it sounds like writing, it needs to sound more like talking
- The best details do double work: establish setting AND character or theme simultaneously

## Common Mistakes
- **Opening with backstory:** Readers don't care about a character's history until they care about the character
- **Telling emotions:** "She felt sad" is a summary. Show the behavior that sadness produces.
- **Dialogue tags:** "Said" is invisible; "exclaimed," "hissed," "chuckled" pull readers out of the scene
- **Adjective overload:** Two precise adjectives beat six vague ones. "The rusted, nail-studded door" beats "the old, worn, deteriorating, damaged door"
- **Resolved tension too fast:** The moment a problem appears is not the moment to solve it—let it breathe
- **Passive protagonist:** If the character isn't making choices, they aren't a protagonist

## Tips & Tricks
- The "iceberg" principle: know ten times more about your character than appears on the page—it shows in the writing
- If your scene could be cut without affecting what comes after, cut it
- Use the last line of a scene or chapter as a hook to the next—end on tension, question, or revelation
- Try writing the climactic scene first to understand what you're building toward
- "What's the worst thing that could happen right now?"—then do that, and your story has momentum
- Read your opening line cold the next day; if it doesn't make you want to know what comes next, rewrite it
